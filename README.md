# income

This project aims to create a robust predictive model to estimate individuals' income levels. By analyzing a dataset containing various socioeconomic factors, we developed a model that can accurately predict whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold. This project is a part of the QBUS2810 course and focuses on practical application of statistical and **linear regression techniques.**
